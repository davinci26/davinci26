### Hi, I'm Sotiris ðŸ‘‹

I like solving problems using technology and code. I am a Software engineer at Microsoft in the Azure Core OS team. I am trying to make Windows the best Edge computing platform. Currently I am contributing to [Envoy Proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy).

If you built something using Envoy on Windows, please reach out! I would love to learn more about.

My DMs are open on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davinci260). I am also experimenting with open office hours (calendly link at [sotiris.dev](sotiris.dev)). Let me know how I can help you!

Unless there is a CLA, code here is my own and probably buggy, so take it as it is.
