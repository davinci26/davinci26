### Hi, I'm Sotiris ðŸ‘‹

I like solving problems using technology and code. I currently work at Reddit on their cloud infrastructure team

I worked as a Software engineer at Microsoft in the Azure Core OS team. At Microsoft I worked on building the first cross-platform service mesh implementation which I co-presented on [KubeCon2021](https://youtu.be/ggvaAbjx4jo). At that time I was a maintainer of [Envoy Proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) and a contributor at [OSM](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm).

If you built something using Envoy on Windows, please reach out! I would love to learn more about it.

My DMs are open on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davinci260). I am also experimenting with open office hours (calendly link at [sotiris.dev](sotiris.dev)). Let me know how I can help you!

Unless there is a CLA, code here is my own and probably buggy, so take it as it is.
